## Assignment Title
Implementation of Selection Sort Algorithm

## Description
This project demonstrates the implementation of the Selection Sort algorithm.
Selection sort works by repeatedly finding the minimum element from the unsorted
part of the array and placing it at the beginning.

## Algorithm Steps
1. Start from the first element.
2. Find the smallest element in the array.
3. Swap it with the first element.
4. Move to the next position.
5. Repeat until the array is sorted.

## Example
Input:  [64, 25, 12, 22, 11]  
Output: [11, 12, 22, 25, 64]

## Language Used
c++

## Repository Purpose
This repository is part of a group assignment demonstrating sorting algorithms using selection sort.
